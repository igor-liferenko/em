For curiosity: make â‰  work as said in point 1 of "Additional features and caveats"
section of cwebman (+ consider that it is UTF-8 sequence)
(it can be typed with Shift+BackSpace - for this to work this setting was added to xkb keymap:
"key <BKSP> { [ BackSpace, U2260 ] };")
For this you will need to understand what means "@s not_eq normal" line in cweave.w,
ctangle.w and common.w
And then you will have to change also encTeX settings (to map these characters to proper
slots in cmtex font) and make these codes of category 11.

when I will finish term, use raw VT100 sequences instead of ncurses

make case-sensivity persist between searches
