Add
volatile int my_var;
void my_SIGWINCH_handler(int signum)
{
  my_var = 1;
}
and on KEY_RESIZE check my_var after initializing ncurses
(check with and without SA_RESTART).
Then try both cases, but before initializing ncurses.
This is to understand if defining own SIGWINCH handler can be done with ncurses.
Afterwards add handler which will simply save all data and close 'em'.
------------------------------
do 100-char border via insert(L'\u258F')
if envvar 'edit' exists, show first param from em.db in red and save it on exit with second param -1
make case-sensivity persist between searches (if we use string of previous search - without typing new string)
