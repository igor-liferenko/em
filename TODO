get rid of MAX_SIZE_T and do not calculate buffer size from sb.st_size and revert commit f89e25c91253a9ac3c4e7b55b4b345a2f0ef2afd
the solution may be to grow the buffer by chunks as we are reading the file
but first understand the buffer-gap algorithm well

make second argument to be the line number to be shown when file is opened

automatically add newline in the end of file if it does not exist
