use separate editor for tex,mf and git, which must not use em.db and must have only
left,right,up,down,backspace and delete keys
-----------------
on exit delete the file and create new file with the same name and save buffer there and
then delete "which em" line from script in README OR add comment why that line is needed
-----------------
do 100-char border via insert(L'\u258F')
-----------------
if envvar 'edit' exists, show first param from em.db in red and save it on exit with second param -1
-----------------
make case-sensivity persist between searches (if we use string of previous search - without typing new string)
-----------------
Display L'\u2010' on gray background
