via xkb patch use [ with Alt modifier to insert substitute for <= (≤) and ] with
Alt modifier to insert substitute for >= (≥); and remove "\let\K=\leftarrow" workaround in cwebmaX.tex when you will make ← work natively (+ consider that it is UTF-8 sequence)
And use Alt modifier with key "1" to use ¬ instead of !
NOTE: do not use substitute for && and || because substitute for || looks like v, and it is better to use non of them than only one of them, because they constitute a pair

implement proper job control as said here:
