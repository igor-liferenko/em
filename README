EM is a UTF-8 capable text editor, written in CWEB.

I have taken the C source from

    http://github.com/hughbarney/zep

and converted it to CWEB, then added UTF-8
support (using wide-character API).

To build EM, install libncursesw5-dev and libtinfo-dev packages,
or build ncurses from source.

Add this `em' script to PATH:

    #!/bin/sh
    file=$1 line=$2 ~/em/em
