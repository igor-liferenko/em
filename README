EM is a UTF-8 capable text editor, written in CWEB.

I have taken the C source from

    http://github.com/hughbarney/zep

and converted it to CWEB, then added UTF-8
support (using wide-character API).

While wide-character support is present in CWEB,
unfortunately it is not complete. There are these two
small issues:

1. Spaces are removed before string literals, and
the `L' wide-character string and character modifer
sticks to previous token.

This can be worked around by prefixing the
`L' modifier with a newline.

2. There is only "wchar_t" type and no "wint_t" type in CWEB
syntax parsing rules. This causes TeX output to be formatted
incorrectly.
It is possible to use workaround like
"@s wint_t wchar_t", but I just changed my local copy of cweave
instead (just added the same stuff for "wint_t" as for "wchar_t").

The things which I'm currently planning to add to zep are:

* automatically save cursor position on exit and restore on open
* implement proper job control as said here:

I am indepted to Hugh Barney on whose initial ideas and code
EM is based.

I also want to express my gratitude to Silvio Levy and
Donald Knuth for CWEB.
