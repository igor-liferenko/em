EM is a UTF-8 capable text editor, written in CWEB.

I have taken the C source from

    http://github.com/hughbarney/zep

and converted it to CWEB, then added UTF-8
support (using wide-character API).
To build it, just type `make'. You will need
ctangle/cweave binaries (ftp://ftp.cs.stanford.edu/pub/cweb/cweb.tar.gz)
and libncursesw5.

I am indepted to Hugh Barney on whose initial ideas and code
EM is based.

I also want to express my gratitude to Silvio Levy and
Donald Knuth for CWEB.

-----------------------------------------------------------

For those, who are not fond of CWEB, the following may be used
to reformat tangled output:

perl -i -pe 's!/\*.*\*/$!\n$&!' em.c
perl -i -ne 'if(/^#line \d+/){undef$prev}else{if(defined$prev){print$prev}$prev=$_}if(eof){print unless m!^/\*.*\*/$!}' em.c # WARNING: this works wrong
cat -s em.c | indent -nce -nut -i2 -kr > em.tmp && mv em.tmp em.c
perl -i -0777 -pe 's/^\s*//' em.c
perl -i -0777 -pe 's/\s+\\(?=\n\n)//g' em.c; perl -i -0777 -pe 's/\s+\\(?=\n\n)//g' em.c

(WARNING: valuable documentation from .w file will be skipped from .c file, because it is intended
only for the eyes of the C compiler)
