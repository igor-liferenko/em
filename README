EM is a UTF-8 capable text editor, written in CWEB.

I have taken the C source from

    http://github.com/hughbarney/zep

and converted it to CWEB, then added UTF-8
support (using wide-character API).

You will need:

  libncursesw5-dev
  libtinfo-dev

Add this `em' script to PATH:

    #!/bin/sh
    if [ $# = 0 ]; then
      tmp=`mktemp -p /tmp tmp-XXXXXX`
      ~/em/em $tmp
      echo $tmp
    elif [ $# = 1 ] && [ "${1#*:}" != "$1" ]; then
      ~/em/em ${1#*:} "${1%:*}"
    else
      ~/em/em "$@"
    fi
