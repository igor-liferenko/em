EM is a UTF-8 capable text editor, written in CWEB.

I have taken the C source from

    http://github.com/hughbarney/zep

and converted it to CWEB, then added UTF-8
support (using wide-character API).

The main feature of EM is that when file is opened again,
the screen is in the same state as when it was closed.

You will need:

  libncursesw5-dev
  libtinfo-dev

To build it, run:

  sed -i 's/struct st\xD0\xB0t/struct stat/' em.w
  ctangle em
  make em
