EM is a UTF-8 capable text editor, written in CWEB.

I have taken the C source from

    http://github.com/hughbarney/zep

and converted it to CWEB, then added UTF-8
support (using wide-character API).

You will need:

  * ctangle (ftp://ftp.cs.stanford.edu/pub/cweb/cweb.tar.gz)
  * libncursesw5-dev
  * libtinfo-dev

To build it, run:

  sed -i 's/struct st–∞t/struct stat/' em.w
  ctangle em
  make em
