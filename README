EM is a UTF-8 capable text editor, written in CWEB.

I have taken the C source from

    http://github.com/hughbarney/zep

and converted it to CWEB, then added UTF-8
support (using wide-character API).

You will need:

  libncursesw5-dev
  libtinfo-dev

To build it, run:

  ctangle em && sed -i s/stXD0XB0t/stat/ em.c
  make em

The feature of this editor is that going to beginning
and end of line uses entire line, and going to previous
line and next line uses line as it is shown on screen.
